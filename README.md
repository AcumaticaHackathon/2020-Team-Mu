# AcuShell

Customization project for Acumatica that adds a c# console to all screens. AcuShell allows live browser-based troubleshooting of Acumatica.
With AcuShell you can:
- access and update values on the current graph;
- change internal variables on the fly;
- execute BQL statement;
- destroy your entire Acumatica instance (use with care :D)
